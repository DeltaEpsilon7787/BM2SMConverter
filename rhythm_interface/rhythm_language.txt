Each VSRG shares certain gameplay elements that could be interpreted the same around all VSRG games.

1. Utilize multiple inheritance to treat gameplay elements properties as traits.
2. traits in the same category may not be combined.
3. If reasonable, traits should be transformable to each other (physical time to beat and vice versa).

Currently known gameplay elements worth caring about:

    Basic class for all rhythm game objects: RhythmObject

Time traits: RhythmTime
    Timed by physical time objects: AbsoluteTime
        Use seconds, ms etc. for position. osu! does this.
    Timed by beat: RelativeTime
        Use beat, measures etc. for position. StepMania, BeatMania do this.
        Relative because the physical position is dependent on BPM and other state.

Key trait: Keyed
    This object is located on some lane.

Fundamental trait: Fundamental
    This trait indicates an object the mere presence of which changes the way the chart is parsed.
    Examples: LNOBJ, LNTYPE in BeatMania.

    This also make an object a meta entity which  must be processed separately in the parser itself.

Declarative trait: Declarative
    This object indicates that this object is not part of the gameplay but rather a message of some kind
      that defines certain metadata of the chart.
    Examples: Title, Subtitle, Difficulty.

    It should not be confused with Fundamental aspect which is processed separately.
    They are also immutable


Structural trait: Structural
    This aspect is usually defined for some kind of timing changes, such as BPM changes.

    Examples: Stops, BPM changes, Time Signature Changes, Warps
